# PIPEBOT-a-pipeline-management-system

# Problems
We all know that pipe inspection has never been one of the cleanest or even the safest job out there. Following are the bottlenecks in the existing system : 

1. Unknown obstacle’s location inside pipeline.
2. Highly time consuming and wastage of resources.
3. Working in unpleasant conditions.
4. Inaccessibility of pipelines due to small diameter or unusual bends.
5. Breaking walls to access the pipeline system.
6. Inspector’s life at risk.

# About the project
A Bluetooth controlled Arduino based  robot which can be controlled wirelessly via a Smartphone.
The robot can move forward, backward, left and right and can also be stopped and hence, can travel deep inside horizontal pipelines. 
The robot can display the distance of an obstacle on an LCD screen.
It alerts the pipe inspectors whenever the it comes too close to an obstacle.
